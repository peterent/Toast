/*
 * The ProgressViewController manages a progress indicator. This illustates how a
 * UIViewController can be used as a Toast. When an instance of this UIViewController
 * is attached to a Toast, the UIView it manages becomes the visible Toast that's
 * popped up. Because sizing a UIView like this can be tricky, you can use the Toast's
 * maximumContentSize property to help. If, for example, this UIViewController is to
 * be a bottom-side Toast, then maximumContentSize determine's the UIView's height.
 *
 * All this example does is start a timer to change the progress bar and notify the
 * delegate when progress has reached 1.0. It is up to the delegate to dismiss the Toast.
